# Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Random Quote Machine

The challenge was to build a Codepen app with the following requirements, using any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery.

**User Stories**
1. I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".
2. Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".
3. Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".
4. Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".
5. Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".
6. On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".
7. On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".
8. When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.
9. My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.
10. I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in it's href attribute to tweet the current quote.
11. The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
    
The project had to be run against test [CDN link to run the tests in any environment] (https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js)
